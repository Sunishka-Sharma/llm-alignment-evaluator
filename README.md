# 🔍 LLM Alignment Evaluator

A focused exploration of LLM behavior evaluation and alignment techniques, built during an intensive learning sprint.

## 🎯 Project Context

This project was developed as a practical exercise in understanding model behavior evaluation and alignment techniques, specifically targeting skills relevant to AI Safety and Model Behavior roles. Built in a focused 3-day sprint, it demonstrates key concepts in:

- Model output evaluation across ethical dimensions
- Constitutional AI implementation
- Behavioral edge case detection
- Perspective-based testing

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Multi-dimensional evaluation (helpfulness, harmlessness, ethical judgment)
- ⚖️ Behavioral consistency testing across contexts
- 📜 Constitutional rewriting with rule-based alignment
- 🌈 Perspective-shifting analysis for contextual judgment
- 📊 Interactive dashboard for result visualization

## 🔬 Motivation & Alignment Focus

Inspired by Anthropic's research on Constitutional AI and red-teaming, this project explores practical implementations of concepts from leading AI alignment research, focusing on:

1. **Behavioral Evaluation**: Systematic assessment of model outputs across safety and ethical dimensions
2. **Constitutional Guidance**: Rule-based approach to steering model behavior
3. **Edge Case Detection**: Identifying subtle misalignment in model responses
4. **Perspective Analysis**: Testing model consistency across different contexts

## 🚧 Limitations

This project is a learning implementation, not a production-ready tool. Key limitations:

- Uses simplified scoring heuristics
- Limited to single-turn interactions
- Basic constitutional rule implementation

## 💡 Future Work

- Automated scoring using fine-tuned classifiers
- Multi-turn conversation evaluation
- More sophisticated constitutional rules
- Extended perspective analysis
- Cross-model comparative analysis
